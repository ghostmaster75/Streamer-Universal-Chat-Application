# Streamer-Universal-Chat-Application
Client to unify Twitch and TikTok chats for streamers

This program is nothing more than a chat unifier to assist streamers who broadcast on multiple platforms in managing and reading their chats without having to switch between windows.
Currently, it only connects to Twitch and TikTok chats, but there are plans to include Discord and Instagram chats as well.
